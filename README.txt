#NFL Draft Data Analysis Project
A simple script that takes in a csv of all NFL draft data going back to 1980. It breaks down the most successful years in rounds in producing HOFers, APs, PBs, games played, and seasons started.

I've also included weighted scores based on performance based on how they ranked in the above categories.

Finally, I processed some administrative info to see if years tend to prefer one side of the ball or a specific position.

First run process.py to ingest the draft data, then run analyze.py to print out all of the data.
